## General info
### A gaming project made in the coding language of Scratch. 
##### * Naming "Jumping Cat"
##### * Inspried by T-rex Game - Google Dinosaur Run. 
##### This is a game where a cat jumping to not touch the obstacles coming/sliding toward it. 

## Technologies Used
### Scratch is a free high-level block-based programming language and online community that allows you to create interactive tales, games, and animations. 
##### Scratch is named after a technique by DJs known as “scratching,” in which vinyl records are clipped together and manipulated on a turntable to produce various sound effects and music. The website, similar to scratching, allows users to creatively mix different media (including visuals, sound, and other programs) by creating and remixing projects such as video games, animations, music, and simulations.

## Features
#### 1 backdrop of the mountain 
#### 3 Sprites
###### 1 jumping cat
###### 2 eggs obtacles

## Setup
#### 1.	Orientating and planning!
##### When I was first introduced to tools for interacting with code and exploring data in this assessment 3, such as Tableau and Python, my coding knowledge has been expanded. Coding, often known as computer programming, is the method through which we connect with computers. Code informs a machine what to do, and writing code is similar to writing a set of instructions. You can teach computers what to do or how to behave considerably more quickly if you learn to write code. You can use this expertise to create websites and apps, handle data, and perform a variety of other exciting things. Almost everything we do in the 4.0 era involves contact with code. Because I am very interested in gaming, I opted to work on games after learning about Scratch software this semester.

I had intended to make an RPG game. However, after analyzing how to make an RPG game, as well as judging by the time and personal level, I believe that such a sophisticated game genre is above my abilities. That is why I chose a jumping game, which is easy to learn and use in this programming.

####  2.	Step-by-step process!
##### * Reference on how to make the game 
##### The YouTube algorithm provided numerous advantages in selecting a plan to create a project. A process for solving a problem or completing a computation is referred to as an algorithm. Algorithms are distinct sets of instructions that perform specified operations in either hardware or software-based processes. When I looked up how to accomplish assessment 3, I was able to view other people's options and determine which projects were appropriate for study. With Scratch Team's 2.8 million views YouTube video “How to make a Jumping Game in Scratch | Tutorial” is also one of the reasons I chose to make a jumping game.

##### * Choosing the Background – Select the backdrop 
##### Scratch includes a large number of data sets. I selected backgrounds that I will be able to use. I chose an environment with a mountain image because the game is cartoon-oriented. 

##### * Character – Select a Sprite 
##### The character is also a Scratch character, with the name "Flying cat." Initially, I considered using a dinosaur character to match the background. Still, the shape of the too-large dinosaurs is also reasonably slow compared to the hurdles provided, making it impossible to jump over. In contrast, the cat is more entertaining and has a slimmer design, making it easier to play with. 

##### * Obstacles – Select Sprites 
##### I chose two of the following images that flashed across the screen after adding obstacles for the cat to jump over: the two eggs. Sprite can also take on a variety of forms, so that is why there are two forms of eggs.

##### * Adding the necessary control – Coding 
##### Selecting the control tool with the space bar makes the cat jump. Program the cat to jump up and down. Please make it so that no two eggs appear at the exact moment and that they slide across the screen when the kitten comes into contact with the egg, and the game end. 

##### * Sound – Sounds tab
##### I use the “Meow 2” sound in the Scratch data set whenever the cat jumps. 

##### * Scoreboard
##### I am adding the scoreboard to keep track of the game's results.

## Usage 
### Code example 
##### To make the scoreboard
<img width="186" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-31 at 16 19 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116043867/198936823-910e5f05-0789-40b6-bc9d-2daa289ec77a.png">

##### To make the cat jump up when space key press and down immediately. When the cat jump, the score board goes 1 up.

##### To make the obstacle (which is the eggs) stop when it touch the cat.

##### To make the eggs glide accross the screen.

##### To make the second obstacle glide after the first egg 1 second.

## Project status
#### Complete. 
##### The game works well. 

## Room for improvement
##### If I had more time, I'd like to learn more about creating obstacles, changing the backdrop, and programming the display to level up to make the game more vibrant.
